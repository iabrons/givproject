				Welcome to our game Snap Attack.  Here is how the game goes:
You have to take a selfie with another person in it.
You also have to be in the picture of the unsuspecting victim.
The person canâ€™t notice that you took a picture of them.
You have to be near the other person while taking the picture (5-10 feet away is acceptable)
The picture should be clear and the other person has to be noticeably in it.
HAVE FUN!
On this web based app we decided to add more features to the game.
